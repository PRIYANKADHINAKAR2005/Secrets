REST API Learning Project with Node.js and EJS
This project demonstrates a simple REST API with a Node.js backend and an EJS-based frontend. Designed to help developers explore and learn how RESTful APIs work, it allows users to send API requests and view responses in a straightforward and interactive way.

Project Overview
The project includes:

Node.js Backend: Implements RESTful API endpoints for various operations.
EJS Frontend: Simple, templated HTML files to interact with the backend.
API Requests: Allows users to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, with responses rendered on the frontend.
Features
User-friendly Frontend: EJS templates provide a structured UI to visualize API responses.
RESTful Endpoints: The project contains endpoints for basic CRUD operations.
Modular Codebase: Organized code structure to separate concerns and make it easy to expand.
